#### Part A: Code Implementation

1. **Canny Edge Detection:**
   - Canny edge detection is manually implemented and the results compared with  OpenCV's Canny edge detection function.

2. **Harris Corner Detection:**
   - Harris corner detection is manually implemented and the results compared with OpenCV's Harris corner detection function.

3. **SIFT Feature Matching and Homography:**
   - Compute SIFT feature vectors and perform feature matching between two images.
   - Compute the sum of squared differences (SSD) between the SIFT vectors.
   - Compute the Homography matrix between the two images and its inverse using MATLAB, Python, or C++.

4. **Integral Image and RGB Feed Display:**
   - An application to compute and display the integral image feed along with the RGB feed was implemented.

5. **Image Stitching for Panoramic Output:**
   - Implement real-time image stitching for a 360-degree panoramic output.
   - 
6. **Integration with Web Application:**
   - The "app.py" file is the web application integration of the assignment. Run the app.py file and click the ip address to be redirected to the webpage.
