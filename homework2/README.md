#### Part A: Code Implementation

1. **Canny Edge Detection:**
   - Implement Canny edge detection manually and compare the results with MATLAB, OpenCV, or DepthAI's Canny edge detection function.

2. **Harris Corner Detection:**
   - Implement Harris corner detection manually and compare the results with MATLAB, OpenCV, or DepthAI's Harris corner detection function.

3. **SIFT Feature Matching and Homography:**
   - Compute SIFT feature vectors and perform feature matching between two images.
   - Compute the sum of squared differences (SSD) between the SIFT vectors.
   - Compute the Homography matrix between the two images and its inverse using MATLAB, Python, or C++.

4. **Integral Image and RGB Feed Display:**
   - Implement an application to compute and display the integral image feed along with the RGB feed.
   - Avoid using built-in functions such as "integral_image(input)".

5. **Image Stitching for Panoramic Output:**
   - Implement real-time image stitching for a 360-degree panoramic output.
   - Utilize any type of features and avoid using built-in functions like "image_stitch(image1, image2)".
   
6. **Integration with Web Application:**
   - Integrate the applications developed for problems 4 and 5 with the web application from Assignment 1, Problem 4.
